Stuff to think about because I realize making images fit is a LITTLE more complicated

- Any key bigger than one unit needs an extra 'space' to account for columns
- May need to adjust master 'unit' size based on the board's width
- Good idea to keep track of each row's character length and, if they come up short from the board
  width, pad them a little
- need to either use a defaultdict to store the keycode:ascii representations orrrr yeah def just defaultdict
  - handling any unique codes like MO(x), etc
- add layer name in
